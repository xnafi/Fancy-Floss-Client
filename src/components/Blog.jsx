                    <p>JSON Web Token is an open industry standard used to share information between two entities, usually a client (like your app’s frontend) and a server (your app’s backend).

                        They contain JSON objects which have the information that needs to be shared. Each JWT is also signed using cryptography (hashing) to ensure that the JSON contents (also known as JWT claims) cannot be altered by the client or a malicious party.</p>

                    <p>JavaScript is a high-level programming language that makes our web pages and web applications dynamic and interactive by giving them the ability to think and act.</p> <br />
                    <p>Node.js is a runtime environment for JavaScript built on Google's v8 engine whose main purpose is to run JavaScript on the server and hence JavaScript can be executed outside of the browser.</p>

                    How does NodeJS handle multiple requests at the same time?
                </div>
                <div className="collapse-content">
                    <p>When a new request comes in, NodeJS checks if it requires any blocking IO operations, if not, the EventLoop processes it and sends the response back to the client directly. If yes, then the request is forwarded to the thread manager, which then based on an algorithm, picks up an idle thread from the pool and lets it process the request. After completion of the request processing operation, the thread, returns the response back to the EventLoop which is then forwarded to the client.</p>
